# SubReddit Keyword Scanner
An extremely naive and brute force comment parser for keywords in a subreddit.

Depending on how many comments there are nested in the thread, reddit will sometimes display all of them at the top level of the thread, or other times, it nests them farther down in the RSS tree and we have to go digging for them. So I just left to go to the max depth no matter what. This is a huge waste of time in most cases. But it works, and I hopefully never have to think about this again.
